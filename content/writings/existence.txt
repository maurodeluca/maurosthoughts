There are moments when you see yourself from far enough away that the usual stories loosen their grip.

Not dramatically, just subtly.

I am a creature on this earth, typing into a machine at a particular moment in history. I was not chosen for this. I did not arrive with instructions. Like everyone else who has ever lived, I occupy a brief stretch of time on an revolving planet, aware for a while, and then replaced by the next turn of awareness.

Seen objectively, there is nothing exceptional about this. It is a perspective that may feel cold at first, because it strips away the comforting idea that life comes with a built-in point. 

No cosmic plan. 
No permanent self. 
No guarantee that any of this means something in the way we’re taught to expect it to.

And yet, something is undeniably happening.

Every human who has ever existed lived their own complete timeline. Each one experienced days that felt ordinary, urgent, boring, meaningful, confusing. Each one stood inside a present moment that felt just as real as this one does now. Then, eventually, their turn ended, not because they failed, but because that is how time moves.

It is not one life happening. It is a relay.

What we call existence is not just being a body, and it is not just having thoughts. It is the connection between the two.

The inside, sensations, thoughts, memories, awareness, and the outside, the physical body, the environment, other people, time. As long as those are connected, experience happens.

The inside receives signals.
The outside responds.
A loop forms.
A point of view appears.

That connection is what it feels like to be alive.

When I was younger, Buddhism resonated deeply with me. Not as a belief system, but as a way of describing experience honestly. It did not promise permanence. It did not try to rescue the self. It simply paid close attention to how things arise and pass.

That understanding returned to me recently in Japan.

I visited a temple and sat to meditate. Nothing dramatic happened. No revelation. But as I sat quietly, something subtle occurred. The room began to feel wider. Not physically larger, just less crowded.

Later, I spoke to a monk who explained it with an image I have never forgotten. He said the mind is like a snow globe. When it is shaken, everything feels dense and close. But when it settles, the flakes fall, and suddenly there appears to be more space, even though nothing new was added.

That space was not an escape from reality. It was reality, without interference.

In Buddhist and Taoist thought, there is no fixed self observing the world from the outside. There is just experience arising when conditions allow it, like breath moving through a body or water finding its level. Existence is not something you possess. It is something that happens when things are in alignment.

It is tempting to imagine the inside as something separate, a passenger that might go somewhere when the body fails. But it is not clear that the inside exists independently at all.

Modern neuroscience suggests the inside is something the body does, not something it contains.

Experience arises when the brain integrates information, maintains memory, updates a model of the world, and continuously links sensation to identity.

When those processes weaken, through sleep, anesthesia, injury, or age, the inside does not retreat. It thins. It fragments. Sometimes it disappears temporarily.

Aging does not so much destroy the inside as it slowly loosens the connection between inside and outside.

Eventually, when the connection can no longer be sustained, experience simply stops occurring. Not sealed away. Not watching from elsewhere. Just no longer generated.

From the inside, there is no experience of being gone. There is only the last moment, and then no next one.

This view removes the idea of a permanent self moving through time untouched. There is no core observer standing outside the process.

The self is a pattern, maintained briefly, changing constantly, real while it is happening.

That can feel unsettling, because we are taught to expect something more durable. But nothing else in nature works that way.

Storms do not persist.
Flames do not persist.
Songs do not persist.

They still happen.

Taoism never asks things to last, only to flow.

Nietzsche saw clearly that there is no meaning handed down from the universe, no external justification waiting at the end. Where he differed from resignation was simple. He believed this was not a loss, but a responsibility.

If life has no assigned meaning, then meaning is something humans create while they are here. Not eternally. Not objectively. But sincerely.

Not by pretending life lasts forever, but by affirming it while it lasts.

On a recent trip to Italy, I spent time with my uncle. He is chatty, funny, observant, the kind of person who speaks plainly without trying to sound wise.

At one point, he said something in Italian that stayed with me. Not poetic nor comforting. Just accurate.

“La vita è qualcosa meravigliosa, ma è un problema. 
Ci sono sempre problemi. 
Che ci piaccia o no, è questo che ci permette di andare avanti.
Per questo ci vuole coraggio e fiducia per vivere.”

Translated that is:

Life is marvellous, but it is a problem.
There are always problems.
If you like it or not, this is what permits use to move forward. 
That is why you need courage and trust to live life.

What struck me was not the tension in the statement, but the acceptance of it.

Life does not resolve itself. There is no moment where the difficulty is finally removed. No stable point where everything makes sense and stays that way.

And yet, it remains marvellous.

Not despite being a problem, but alongside it.

Courage is not about eliminating uncertainty. Trust is not about guarantees. They are what allow you to live fully inside something fragile, temporary, and unresolved, and still say yes to it.

If everyone gets a limited number of days, and every person’s experience is just as real while it is happening, then this moment does not need cosmic permission to matter.

It matters because it is occurring.

This is not a rehearsal.
This is not a waiting room.
This is not a test.
This is a brief alignment.
Inside connected to outside.
Awareness lit.
The universe briefly noticing itself from one angle.

Then the turn passes on.

And maybe the point is not to last, but to have the courage to live, and the trust to notice the marvel, while the connection holds.
