**I'm done pretending the hiring and recruitment industry isn't deeply broken.**

We're living through a global job market collapse dressed up as "opportunity." Mass layoffs, fake job postings, endless interview rounds, automated rejections, and a culture of suspicion so ingrained that interviewers now assume your CV is a work of fiction by default. Every interaction feels less like a conversation and more like an interrogation designed to catch you bluffing.

And before the usual rebuttals come in, yes, I know the arguments.

"Thinking out loud is intelligence."
"Big O matters."
"Reasoning through a problem shows capability."
"Surely we can tell if someone's good from this."

But here's the uncomfortable truth: those methods still don't reliably measure whether someone can do this job, in this company, with this team. They measure how well someone performs under artificial pressure, in a highly specific context, optimised for speed and recall. They measure familiarit with interview formats, not long-term effectiveness. Even Google has publicly acknowledged that many of its earlier hiring heuristics were over-weighted and less predictive than expected. **What we test for is mostly a proxy, and a noisy one at that.**

This obsession with *"measurable intelligence"* has a history we rarely acknowledge. IQ testing itself was never neutral. It emerged in the early 20th century entangled with eugenics, classism, and the belief that human capability could be ranked, filtered, and standardised. Modern psychology recognises intelligence as contextual, dynamic, and shaped by environment. Hiring, however, has not caught up. We still cling to narrow, artificial indicators because they feel objective, even when they are not.

Coding and problem solving have fundamentally changed. Abstraction is higher. Tooling is better. Collaboration is constant. The definition of intelligence has shifted away from memorising algorithms and towards judgment, learning speed, communication, and adaptability. As Einstein is often paraphrased, *never memorise something you can look up*. Yet people are rejected from real jobs because they didn't immediately produce the "most optimal" solution to a contrived problem, or recall how to traverse a linked list they may never manually implement in their career.

I've literally been asked, out of the blue, **"But can you even Kubernetes?"** as if the inability to already know a specific tool is some kind of moral failing. As if learning new systems isn't part of the job. As if competence is static. As if growth is suspicious.

The same goes for careers that don't follow a single narrow track. Changing roles, exploring adjacent fields, building breadth instead of tunnelling into one niche is treated as a red flag. Meanwhile, the CEO of NVIDIA worked at McDonald's before his career took shape. Nobody sane would argue that path disqualified him from leading one of the most influential tech companies in the world.

**Somewhere along the way, curiosity, growth, and humanity became liabilities.**

I took a gap year to broaden my horizons and explore other areas of my life. To recover. To live. Life has a way of throwing events at you that feel impossible to overcome. Decisions I made, paths I took, outcomes I couldn't foresee. Those moments can shape your mental health as much as your career. Burnout, stress, and the weight of uncertainty triggered my depression. But **rest and exploration are quietly penalised**, treated as something to explain away, while resilience is measured by how long you can grind without breaking.

Interviewers dig relentlessly into the weakest moments of your career while barely acknowledging what you have built so far. How many times do you need to justify a pivot? How many times do you need to defend a decision that made you healthier, wiser, and more grounded? **Character and context are no longer valued.** Instead, candidates are expected to recite definitions, answer hypothetical questions detached from reality, and design systems on the spot that likely took entire teams months to figure out.

I recently went through **six interviews** with one company. I received positive feedback at every stage. I spent weekends completing assessments, investing serious time and care into work I genuinely believed in. When I finally presented the code, it was barely reviewed. The final decision came down to vague feedback about *"alignment"* during a director meeting. No substance. No accountability. Just months of effort dissolved into a corporate euphemism.

**That is not assessment. That is extraction.**

And here's the part many companies don't like admitting: there is no reliable, deterministic way to measure someone's true capability in advance. Not with interviews. Not with tests. Not with take-home assignments. That uncertainty is not the candidate's failure. **It's the nature of complex human work.**

Which is exactly why probation periods exist. Companies already have a built-in mechanism to assess real performance in real conditions, over time, with real support. Six months of actual work will always tell you more than six rounds of interviews ever could. Yes, it carries risk. Yes, it costs time. But pretending that today's hiring rituals eliminate that risk is self-deception, not rigour.

Not all companies are like this. Some still get it right. But enough are broken that pretending otherwise feels dishonest.

What we have now is a system that actively manufactures imposter syndrome. A system that rewards performance over substance, confidence over competence, and familiarity over potential. A system bloated with feedback forms and survey responses that will never be meaningfully read, only stored indefinitely in some database until a future AI cyborg rises, studying the patterns of our exhaustion, and builds a religion devoted to the worship of algorithms, efficiency, and the perfection of human compliance. **That is the world hiring has made for us if we stay silent.**

At some point, I realised that instead of begging for acceptance, I needed to sing my own praises, *quietly, internally*, to remind myself that my work, my choices, my learning, and my growth mattered. Not for anyone else. Not for the approval of committees or directors. **That simple act of recognising my own worth has been far more sustaining** than trying to force the system to give me permission to exist.

Maybe there isn't a clean solution. For centuries, work was judged differently. Apprentices learned from masters, reputations mattered, and people were evaluated by what they actually produced. Globalization and multinational corporations turned that into a system that prizes conformity, speed and metrics over understanding. 

Diversity initiatives meant to expand opportunity are often overshadowed by subtle pressures: candidates who will accept lower pay, endure longer hours, or come from educational systems drilled to excel at role memorization and Olympiad-style problem-solving. And it isn't fair to them either! **The system exploits their willingness**, while salary increases barely keep pace with inflation. People are rarely encouraged to speak openly about this, for fear of jealousy or workplace disruption, leaving everyone trapped in a cycle of silence and compromise 

The system rewards familiarity, and with it comes in-group bias. Hiring people who think and work like those already inside, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that narrows perspective and repeats the cycle endlessly. **It's structural. Systematic. And designed to repeat itself ad infinitum.**

I'm not writing this to burn bridges or because I can't accept a rejection. **I'm writing it because silence is part of the problem.** Hiring and the rejection one faces from it does not need to be adversarial. It does not need to be dehumanising. And it does not need to confuse suffering with seriousness.

Work matters, but it is not everything. People are not problems to be solved in forty-five minutes. Intelligence is not demonstrated by how efficiently someone jumps through hoops someone else decided mattered. **Life and capability are far more complex than any test, and that is not your fault.**

If this resonates, **you are not broken.**
**The system is.**
